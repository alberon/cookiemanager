## Basic usage

```js
CookieManager.add({
    // A name to identify this type of cookie
    name:                    "analytics",

    // Run immediately if the user has opted in
    if_opted_in:             function() {},

    // Run immediately if the user has opted out
    if_opted_out:            function() {},

    // Run immediately if the user hasn't made a choice
    if_unknown:              function() {},

    // Run at DOM ready if the user has opted in (requires jQuery)
    at_ready_if_opted_in:    function() {},

    // Run at DOM ready if the user has opted out (requires jQuery)
    at_ready_if_opted_out:   function() {},

    // Run at DOM ready if the user hasn't made a choice (requires jQuery)
    at_ready_if_unknown:     function() {},

    // Run when the user changes status to opt in
    at_opt_in:               function() {},

    // Run when the user changes status to opt out
    at_opt_out:              function() {},

    // Run when the user clears their cookies
    at_reset:                function() {},
});
```

`name` is required. All event handlers (methods) are optional.

Different handlers should have different names if the user can opt in/out of
them separately. Alternatively you can add multiple handlers with the same
name and they will be linked together - i.e. events will be run on all
handlers with the same name (in the order they are added).

You can provide a string instead of a function and the method with that name
will be run instead. For example:

```js
CookieManager.add({
    name:            'sample',

    // This is a custom method called run()
    run:             function() {},

    // The run() method will be called immediately if the user is opted in
    if_opted_in:     'run',

    // The same run() method will be called when the user opts in
    at_opt_in:       'run',

    // You can use an array to attach multiple event handlers, e.g.
    at_opt_out:      ['delete_cookies', 'show_warning_bar']
});
```

Within the event handlers above (and custom methods) you can call:
- `this.get_status()` - returns 'accept', 'block' or 'unknown'
- `this.opt_in()` - set status to 'accept'
- `this.opt_out()` - set status to 'block'
- `this.reset()` - set status to 'unknown' (delete setting)

Note: Because of this you should not create any custom method with these
names.

You can also call these methods directly, passing in the name:

- `CookieManager.get_status(name)`
- `CookieManager.opt_in(name)`
- `CookieManager.opt_out(name)`
- `CookieManager.reset(name)`

These is also a method to reset all known settings at once:

- `CookieManager.reset_all()`

Some helper methods for working with cookies are available:

- `CookieManager.get_cookie(name, defaultValue)`
- `CookieManager.set_cookie(name, value, expires, path, domain, secure)`
- `CookieManager.delete_cookie(name, path, domain, secure)`

The following config options can be set *after* loading this file but
*before* calling any methods:

- `CookieManager.cookie_name = 'cookieName';` (Default: `CookieManager`)
- `CookieManager.cookie_days = 730;` (Default: 2 years)

Note: Only one cookie is used for all handlers. They are concatenated in
the format "handler1=allow,handler2=block", where "handler1" is the 'name'
property specified when adding the handler.

## Example: Google Analytics
```js
// Google Analytics
CookieManager.add({

    name: 'ga',

    // Run the tracking code (once only)
    has_run: false,
    run: function() {
        if (!this.has_run) {
            window._gaq = window._gaq || [];
            _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X']);
            _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);

            var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;
            ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl' : 'http://www') + '.google-analytics.com/ga.js';
            var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s);

            this.has_run = true;
        }
    },

    // If the user opts out, delete all Google Analytics cookies
    delete_cookies: function() {
        var domain = document.location.hostname;
        domain = '.' + domain.replace(/^www\./, '');
        CookieManager.delete_cookie('__utma', '/', domain);
        CookieManager.delete_cookie('__utmb', '/', domain);
        CookieManager.delete_cookie('__utmc', '/', domain);
        CookieManager.delete_cookie('__utmv', '/', domain);
        CookieManager.delete_cookie('__utmz', '/', domain);
    },

    // Event handlers
    if_opted_in: 'run',
    //if_unknown: 'run', // Implied consent?
    at_opt_in: 'run',
    at_opt_out: 'delete_cookies'
});
```

Then you would build a UI that uses these method calls to get/set the status:

- `CookieManager.get_status('ga')` (returns `accept`, `block` or `unknown`)
- `CookieManager.opt_in('ga')`
- `CookieManager.opt_out('ga')`

Or you could build it into the same object.

Or you could have a separate object with the same name, to keep them independent.

## Advanced usage

You can register an event handler to be notified when the user changes the
status for any cookie handler:

```js
CookieManager.subscribe("set_status", function(name, status) { ... });
```

The CookieManager.add() method returns a CookieManagerHandler instance that
includes all your custom methods/properties and the ones listed above
(`get_status`, `opt_in`, `opt_out`, `reset`).

You can also create a CookieManagerHandler instance manually if you want and
pass that to `CookieManager.add()` instead of a plain object.

## Developer notes

The following properties & methods are for internal use only:

- `CookieManager.handlers` - An array holding all the handlers
- `CookieManager.get_statuses()` - Returns an object of statuses, e.g. `{handler1: "allow"}`
- `CookieManager.run(handler, methodName)` - Run the named method on the given handler object (if possible)
- `CookieManager.runAll(name, methodName)` - Run the named method on all handlers with the given name
